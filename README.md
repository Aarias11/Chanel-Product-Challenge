# Chanel-Product-Challenge


This is a Chanel Product Challenge from frontendmentor.io. I enjoyed doing this project. Although as a beginner, 
i am feeling more and more confident with laying out the pages and using flexbox. 
Finding the green color for the price and add to cart button was a bit difficult but found one as close as possible.
It feels like i am not the one who even made this LOL. 
One thing i know im having a bit of trouble with is centering a box in the middle of the page without having to use transform: translateY(axis)
